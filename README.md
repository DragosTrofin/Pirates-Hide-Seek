Pirates Hide&Seek is a board game where you have 4 little 9x9 blocks and you are given a challenge and 4 other pieces that you can cover the blocks in order to pass the challenge. The game has 2 themes with soundtrack. After making this project I learned about some C++ concepts such as maping and I also used SFML to create the game graphics.
